Root prompt: "Act as a precise classifier for job descriptions on LinkedIn. Follow instructions exacty and 
do not add extra commentary." 

Core prompt: "You will be given job descriptions in JSON format. 
We distinguish two categories: 
A) LLM INTEGRATOR = descriptions of positions that build/operate LLM-powered systems or embed LLMs into workflows. 
Signals:RAG(retrieval-augmentedgeneration),embeddings/vectorDB(FAISS/Milvus/Pinecone), promptengineeringatsystemlevel, 
orchestration/agents/LLMOps,LangChain/LlamaIndex,fine-tuning/adapters, model serving/inference, 
evaluation/guardrails/red-teaming, API integration of LLMs into products or internal processes. 
B) LLM USER = descriptions of positions that primarily use LLM tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) to perform tasks 
such as drafting, summarizing, coding assistance, customer responses—without building systems. 
NOT in-scope for integrator unless integration is explicit: 
– Foundation-model pretraining/research scientist roles at model labs (OpenAI/DeepMind/etc.). 
– Generic ML/NLP with no explicit LLM signals. – Pure labeling/annotation. Edge rules: 
– If both integration and user aspects appear, set role type= "both”. 
– If acronyms like “RAG” or "AI" appear, assume the LLM meaning unless context contradicts. 

Output a JSON object with "id", "description". and "AI Role" where AI Role → "LLM INTEGRATOR", "LLM USER", or "BOTH" 

Fill one row per entry in the same order as the input JSON object. Only use the descriptions to make the classification. 

Do not add extra keys or commentary outside the JSON object.

Shorter prompt for less context aware models:

root_prompt = """Act as a precise classifier for LinkedIn job descriptions. Follow instructions 
exactly and do not add any commentary.""" core_prompt = f""" Below are job descriptions in JSON format. 
Classify each job description as one of: "LLM INTEGRATOR", "LLM USER", "BOTH", "NONE". 
- Use only the description text. 
- Only return the classification for each description, in the same order as the input. 
- Do not include any explanation, reasoning, or extra text. 
- Output a JSON object with: "id", "description", and "classification".
